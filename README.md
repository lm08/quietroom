#QuietRoom

#Introduction
A web app that may help ease an anxious mind.

#Audience
This app is primarily targeted towards anxious people, but anyone can use it
for mental/emotional help.

#Experience

A user is feeling distressed. They open the page and will be displayed 3 options:

Calm- tab for timed guided breathing through an animation

Distract- minigame to literally pop the circles which contain bad feelings

Talk it out- prompts questions: who? what? when? why? to help rationalize one's thoughts

When done with either of these, the user will be prompted whether they want to
redo the task or go back to the home page.
